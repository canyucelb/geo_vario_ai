# Variogram Modeling with Reinforcement Learning and Genetic Algorithms
This repository contains code that automates the variogram modeling process using an approach comparing Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Genetic Algorithms (GA). Our framework is designed to objectively infer variogram parameters for complex, nested variogram structures—crucial for geostatistical analysis in earth sciences and subsurface modeling.

## Overview
Accurate variogram modeling is a cornerstone for understanding spatial and temporal heterogeneities in geologic attributes. Traditional methods often depend heavily on subjective decisions and expert insights, which can lead to inconsistencies—especially when data are sparse. This project addresses those challenges by:

### Automating Variogram Inference: 
Using an RL agent that iteratively adjusts variogram parameters based on a reward mechanism, reflecting discrepancies between predicted and observed outcomes.
Enhancing Optimization: Integrating a GA to explore a diverse population of candidate models, ensuring a robust search for the global optimum.
### Supporting Complex Models: 
Enabling the modeling of nested variogram structures to capture multifaceted spatial variability.
## How It Works
Reinforcement Learning Agent
### Policy Learning: 
The RL agent learns an optimal policy by iteratively adjusting variogram parameters (e.g., nugget, sill, and range).
### Reward System: 
After each adjustment, the agent receives a reward based on how goodness measure of the estimated variogram matches actual spatial measurements.
### Convergence: 
Over time, the agent converges to a policy that maximizes cumulative rewards, resulting in improved variogram estimates.
## Genetic Algorithm Optimizer
### Population-Based Search: 
The GA evolves a population of candidate variogram models using genetic operators like mutation, crossover, and selection.
### Global Optimization: 
This approach mitigates local optima traps and enhances the RL process by exploring a broader solution space.
## Features
### Automated Variogram Inference: 
Minimizes subjectivity by automating the parameter tuning process.
### Customizable Framework: 
Easily adjust the reward functions, GA parameters, and RL settings to suit different datasets and geostatistical challenges.
### Support for Nested Structures: 
Capable of modeling complex, multi-scale spatial heterogeneities.
